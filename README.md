# Virtual Drumset Kit

## Description

The **Virtual Drumset Kit** is an interactive project that transforms your webcam into a virtual musical instrument. By harnessing the power of computer vision and audio processing, the system tracks hand movements in real time to simulate playing a drum set. When a user moves their hand into predefined drum zones on the screen, corresponding drum sounds are triggered—providing a fun and immersive musical experience. This project integrates OpenCV and MediaPipe for robust hand tracking and gesture recognition, while Pygame handles real-time sound playback and visual feedback.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking:**  
  Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks from webcam video streams, enabling accurate and responsive gesture detection.

- **Gesture-Based Drum Playing:**  
  Processes live video with OpenCV to identify the position of the index finger. When the fingertip enters designated drum regions, the corresponding sound is played.

- **Interactive Visual Interface:**  
  Draws visual drum zones on the video feed with OpenCV, allowing users to see which drum region is active and enhancing the overall interactivity.

- **Customizable Sound Mapping:**  
  Drum sounds are loaded via Pygame, and the drum regions can be easily adjusted to accommodate different setups or preferences.

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  The project is organized into separate modules for hand tracking and drum kit functionality, making it simple to extend or integrate with other applications.

## Project Files and Functionality

- **`handtrackingmodule.py`**  
  - **Purpose:** Encapsulates hand tracking functionality using MediaPipe.  
  - **Functionality:**  
    - Initializes MediaPipe’s Hands module with configurable detection and tracking parameters.  
    - Processes webcam frames to detect hand landmarks and draws them on the image for visualization.  
    - Provides methods to return the positions of specific hand landmarks.

- **`main.py` (Virtual Drumset Application)**  
  - **Purpose:** Serves as the main entry point of the application, integrating hand tracking with audio playback.  
  - **Functionality:**  
    - Initializes the webcam and captures live video frames.  
    - Uses the `HandTracker` class to detect hand positions in each frame.  
    - Defines drum regions on the screen and checks if the index finger tip (landmark 8) is within any region.  
    - Plays the corresponding drum sound via Pygame if the hand is detected in a drum region (with cooldown logic to prevent spamming).  
    - Provides real-time visual feedback by drawing drum zones and labels on the video feed.

## Underlying Technologies

- **Python:** Core programming language for rapid development.
- **OpenCV (cv2):** Handles video capture, image processing, and drawing operations.
- **MediaPipe:** Provides robust and efficient hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Pygame:** Manages audio playback and creates an interactive interface.
- **Additional Libraries:** `time`, `os` for auxiliary functions and file management.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization:**  
   - The system initializes the webcam and creates a `HandTracker` object to handle hand detection.
   - Pygame is initialized for sound playback, and drum sound files are loaded from a designated folder.
   - Predefined screen regions are set up to correspond with different drum sounds.

2. **Real-Time Processing:**  
   - Each video frame is captured and flipped horizontally for a mirror effect.
   - The `HandTracker` processes the frame to detect hand landmarks.
   - The position of the index finger tip is checked against each drum region.
   - If the fingertip enters a drum region and the cooldown period has elapsed, the appropriate drum sound is played.
   - Drum regions and labels are drawn on the video feed for real-time visual feedback.

3. **User Interaction:**  
   - The application runs continuously until the user presses the 'q' key, at which point the webcam is released and all windows are closed.
